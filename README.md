# people-plotting-grid

This is a very simple, under-engineered node-mongo back end for FVI's ReactJS people plotting application. It serves its purpose and will not be expanded into a full fledged user portal for the foreseeable future.

This is an application that was developed specifically to target a need and delivered with agility - rather than expansibility - in mind. If it grows then obviously it will be refactored in such a way that allows expansibility. The first refactoring task would be to have a database collection to activate or deactivate admin privileges for the users in the Federated Domains (fvi.edu and nhflorida.com).
